# Project 0
I made a website about shoes. This website talks about the many different shapes, types, and materials that shoes can come in. There are a total of four pages in this website. The pages are index.html, types.html, materials.html, and shapes.html. I also used many different CSS and bootstrap elements to make the website look good.
